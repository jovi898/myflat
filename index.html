                        A small room, the floor is laid with a carpet on which furniture is placed. On it there is a
                        small curbstone with the TV, opposite which there is a sofa with two armchairs. Also in the room
                        there is a large closet with photos, books, utensils, notebooks, documents and much more.Our
                        living-room is light and comfortable. There is only one window in it, but it's very large. There
                        is modern furniture in our living-room. There is a wall-unit, a TV-set, a sofa, two armchairs
                        and a table in the room. There is a large carpet on the floor. But there is no carpet on the
                        wall. There are some pictures on the walls. I like to watch TV in the living-room and to play or
                        talk with my parents in the evening there

                        The bedrooms are also nice and cosy. My parents’ bedroom is larger than mine. They have two beds
                        there, a bedside table with an alarm clock and an electric lamp on it, some chairs and a
                        wardrobe. There is a lovely carpet on the floor between the beds.
                        My room is the smallest room in our flat, but it is very cosy and light. There is a bed, a
                        wardrobe, a desk, an armchair and several bookshelves in my room. There is a thick carpet on the
                        floor. The walls in my room are light brown and there are some big posters on them. I like my
                        room very much, but from time to time I change it round. Quite often I move the bed and change
                        the posters on the wall.

                        Our kitchen is large and light. It is very well equipped. We’ve got a refrigerator, a freezer, a
                        microwave oven, a coffee maker and a toaster. We haven’t got a dishwasher yet, because it is
                        very expensive. But I’m sure we shall buy one in the near future. Usually we have our meals in
                        the kitchen. When we have a party we lay the big table in the living room
